# Link Divider

Application makes few links from shared link. You may share few links for anyone. Anyone must open each link for getting one shared link.
Working application is here [https://bagau.github.io/divider/](https://bagau.github.io/divider/).

How to run application:
1. Clone repository
2. Install angular-cli `npm i -g angular-cli`
3. Run `ng serve -o` for local view

UPDATE 23.08.18. I decided change this application from divider links to sharing encrypted links.
